    <string-array name="depaolo">
        <string name="name">DePaolo Hall</string>
        <string name="info">\t \t   The DePaolo Hall was built in 1970 and was the original cafeteria on campus.
            After Wagoner Hall opened in 1989, the building was renamed Westside Hall because of its geographic
            location on campus. It houses student services including Abrons Student Health Center, CARE
            and Crossroads, University Testing Services, Disability Services, the University Learning
            Center, and University College. On April 29, 2011, the UNCW Board of Trustees announced the
            renaming of Westside Hall to DePaolo Hall in honor of Rosemary DePaolo, who retired June 30
            after eight years as Chancellor. The naming recognizes Dr. DePaolos leadership at UNCW and
            her commitment to put students first while accomplishing the ambitious strategic goals of her
            administration.</string>
